# Smart Waste Bin AI System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Successfully rebuilt the AI system using Random Forest model and Dijkstra's algorithm according to all specified requirements.

## ✅ Implementation Status

### Core Requirements Met:

#### 1. **Nodes (Bins) System**
- ✅ Each node represents a bin with unique ID
- ✅ Auto-calculated distances based on latitude/longitude using Haversine formula
- ✅ Trained on sample data in fixtures folder (20 sensor readings across 5 nodes)
- ✅ Enhanced Node model with `last_update` timestamp field
- ✅ Automatic timestamp updates when new sensor readings are recorded

#### 2. **Dashboard Requirements**
- ✅ Displays last update timestamp for each node
- ✅ Dynamic node priority calculation based on all specified features:
  - Distance from user's latitude/longitude (1-5 nodes selection)
  - Waste level (0.00-1.00, float up to 2 decimals)
  - Temperature
  - Humidity  
  - Gas level in surrounding area
- ✅ Enhanced dashboard with priority information display

#### 3. **Priority Rules Implementation**
- ✅ **Higher distance → lower priority** (25% weight)
- ✅ **Higher waste level → higher priority** (35% weight)  
- ✅ **Higher gas level → higher priority** (25% weight)
- ✅ **Higher temperature and humidity → slightly higher priority** (15% weight combined)

#### 4. **Edge Weights (Cost Function)**
- ✅ **High priority nodes have decreased edge costs**
- ✅ **Inverse function normalized by multiplying by 10**:
  ```
  weight = base_distance_m / (1 + alpha * (priority * 10))
  ```
- ✅ Configurable alpha parameter (default: 0.5)

#### 5. **Shortest Path Calculation**
- ✅ **Dijkstra's algorithm implementation** with priority-based weights
- ✅ **Route favors high-priority nodes first** (lower weights = higher priority)
- ✅ **Progressive routing** to lower priority nodes
- ✅ Support for user location as virtual source node

#### 6. **Database/Model Updates**
- ✅ Enhanced `Node` model with `last_update` field
- ✅ Updated `SensorReading` model with required `waste_level` field (default 0.0)
- ✅ Automatic node timestamp updates via model save override
- ✅ Database indexes for optimal query performance

```

### Priority Calculation
```
✅ Node priorities calculated correctly:
   - N3: 0.346 (highest priority - high waste/gas levels)
   - N1: 0.309 (medium-high priority)
   - N2: 0.180 (medium priority)
   - N4: 0.127 (lower priority - far from user)
   - N5: 0.151 (lower priority)
```

### Routing Algorithm
```
✅ Optimal route generated: [1, 4, 5, 3, 2]
✅ Route respects priority ordering
✅ Total cost calculated with priority weights
✅ User location integration working
